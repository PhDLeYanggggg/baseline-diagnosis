# Statistical methods for group comparisons
 
- If normality and homoskedasticity hold → **ANOVA + Tukey's HSD**; effect size reported as **η²**.

- Otherwise → **Kruskal–Wallis + Dunn**. Pairwise p-values are **FDR (Benjamini–Hochberg)** corrected.

- Plots display **violin + jitter**, with **median (red)** and **IQR (black)**. Significance is shown as stars (* p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001).

- For non-parametric comparisons, we report **Cliff’s δ** as the effect size.
